# Compliance Standards (Company / Project)

> **Scope**: Project-specific compliance rules. Keep this short, directive, and unambiguous.

> **ALWAYS**:
> - Follow your organization’s compliance policy for this repo (data classification, retention, access)
> - Treat all PII/PHI/PCI as sensitive and enforce least privilege
> - Ensure audit logs exist for privileged actions and data export

> **NEVER**:
> - Store or log secrets/credentials in source control
> - Copy production PII into dev environments without approval and sanitization
