# YAML Code Style

> **Scope**: YAML formatting rules

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS

> **ALWAYS**: Spaces (never tabs)
> **ALWAYS**: 2-space indentation (or project standard)
> **ALWAYS**: Quote ambiguous strings (`on`, `off`, `yes`, `no`, dates)
> 
> **NEVER**: Tabs
> **NEVER**: Inconsistent indentation

## Best Practices

```yaml
# ✅ Correct
name: "on"  # Quoted (would be boolean without quotes)
version: "2024-01-01"  # Quoted (would be parsed as date)
description: |
  Multiline content
  using block scalar

# ❌ Wrong
name: on  # Parsed as boolean!
version: 2024-01-01  # Parsed as date!
```

## AI Self-Check

- [ ] Spaces (not tabs)?
- [ ] Consistent 2-space indentation?
- [ ] Ambiguous strings quoted?
- [ ] Block scalars for multiline?
- [ ] Stable key ordering?
