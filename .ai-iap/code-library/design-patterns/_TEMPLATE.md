## TypeScript

### [Approach/Variant Name] (Recommended)

```typescript
// Pattern implementation here
// 20-100 lines showing complete, working implementation
// Include interfaces, classes, and core pattern structure
```

**Usage Example:**
```typescript
// Real-world usage showing how to use the pattern
// 5-20 lines demonstrating practical application
```

### [Alternative Approach]

```typescript
// Alternative implementation
// Show different way to achieve the same pattern
```

---

## Python

### [Approach Name] (Recommended)

```python
# Pattern implementation here
# 20-100 lines showing complete, working implementation
# Include classes, methods, and core pattern structure
```

**Usage Example:**
```python
# Real-world usage showing how to use the pattern
# 5-20 lines demonstrating practical application
```

### [Alternative Approach]

```python
# Alternative implementation
# Show different way to achieve the same pattern
```
